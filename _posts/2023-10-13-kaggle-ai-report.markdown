 Kaggle's 2023 AI Report is out right now! The report is a collection of 20+ essays written by Kaggle community members covering the latest AI advancements and salient topics in modern ML.

 In true Kaggle fashion, this report was community-driven and coordinated through a Kaggle competition. We challenged participants to write in-depth essays on important topics like generative AI and AI ethics and recruited a panel of Kaggle grandmasters to select those included in the report.
