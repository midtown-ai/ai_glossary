# Jackknife Sampling Method

 A large number of samples are obtained by removing one data point at a time from the original dataset, and the model is trained and tested on these samples. This method is used to estimate the sensitivity of a model's performance to individual observations in the dataset.

# Jailbreaking

 Similar to [Red Teaming], but also encompass every method to bypass controls for the model's generated output.

# Join Distribution

 Joint distribution is based on joint probability, which can be simply defined as the probability of two events (variables) happening together. These two events are usually coined event A and event B, and can formally be written as:

 ```
p(A and B)
 ```

 Joint distribution, or joint probability distribution, shows the probability distribution for two or more random variables. Hence:

 ```
f(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)
 ```
