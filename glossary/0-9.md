# 0-1 Loss Function

 One of the simplest loss function that is calculated based on accuracy.

 ```
this model classified 7 objects correctly (assigned them the correct class labels) and 3 objects incorrectly.
So my loss function would return "0" 7 times and "1" 3 times 
Your 1's become indicators for misclassified items, regardless of how they were misclassified. (could be many classes)
 ```
